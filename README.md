The team aims to expand and apply the knowledge of the real engineering industry to develop an compact and portable embedded system for gait analysis and provide real-time therapy feedback to doctors and improve gait balance for patients at the Barrow Institute. <br /> <br />

## <br /> Proposed Concepts <br />
### Sole
<img src="./IMAGES/Concept1-Sole.png"  width="100%" height="100%">
The sole mainly consists of a conductive sensing material such as a Velostat that will act as a pressure sensor. These will be connected to copper tape to transmit the analog signal generated from the sensed pressure to a wire connected to the microcontroller. The conductive sensing materials will be placed at specific points that the foot normally comes into contact with while walking. The soles will then be covered with electrical tape to protect the sensors as well as the user's feet. The microcontroller will be placed in a separate housing with a daughterboard, vibrator, and accelerometer that will be strapped near the user's ankle. The vibrator will be used for bio-feedback purposes. <br /> <br />
### Socks
<img src="./IMAGES/Concept2-Sock.png"  width="100%" height="100%">

Pressure-sensitive socks are made of washable and comfortable microfibre laced with Velostat (a thin pressure-sensitive material) to relay the data required to the microcontroller through copper strips. We will try to infuse the controller, and IMU into the socks but if it's not possible, they will be attached to the sock using a detachable casing. These detachable casings will be sold separately thereby reducing the recurring costs if they break. Haptic feedback will be given using small vibration devices.

## CAD Designs
Pressure-sensitive socks are made of washable and comfortable microfibre laced with Velostat to relay the data required to the microcontroller through copper strips. These will be connected to copper tape to transmit the analog signal generated from the sensed pressure to a wire connected to the microcontroller. The conductive sensing materials will be placed at specific points that the foot normally comes into contact with while walking. The microcontroller will be placed in a separate housing with a daughterboard, linear vibration motor, and accelerometer that will be strapped near the user's ankle. These detachable casings will be sold separately thereby reducing the recurring costs if they break. Haptic feedback will be given using small linear vibration motor devices. The team will make sure that all embedded devices are sealed properly so that the device can be cleaned regularly.
